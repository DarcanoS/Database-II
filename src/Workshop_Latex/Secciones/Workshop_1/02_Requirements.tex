\subsubsection*{Non-Functional Requirements Justification}

\textbf{NFR2 (24/7 streaming ingestion):} Air quality monitoring requires continuous data collection since pollution levels fluctuate throughout the day and immediate detection of hazardous conditions is critical for public health.

\textbf{NFR4 (10 seconds report generation):} Complex reports with multiple filters and large datasets require processing time, but 10 seconds maintains user engagement while allowing for comprehensive data analysis.

\textbf{NFR5 (10 minutes update frequency):} Air quality APIs from external sources typically update their information every 10 minutes to 1 hour, making more frequent updates unnecessary and resource-intensive.

\textbf{NFR6 (2 seconds data loading):} Critical safety information like air quality alerts must be delivered quickly to enable timely user decisions about outdoor activities and health precautions.

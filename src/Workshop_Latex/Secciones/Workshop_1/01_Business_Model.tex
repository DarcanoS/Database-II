\subsection*{How Does It Work?}
The platform collects environmental, meteorological and geospatial data from official sources and third-party APIs. The information is cleaned, processed and stored in a hybrid architecture using relational and analytical databases. Users access the results through real-time dashboards, historical analyses, downloadable reports and interactive spatial visualizations.

\subsection*{Who Uses the Platform?}
The system serves citizens monitoring exposure levels, government agencies issuing alerts or designing policies, companies and NGOs evaluating environmental impact, and academic institutions that require reliable datasets for analysis or research.

\subsection*{How Does It Generate Revenue?}
Monetization focuses on premium access to advanced dashboards and reports, API data services, consulting for institutions and licensing analytical dashboards to organizations such as universities or municipalities.

\subsection*{What Technologies Does It Use?}
The platform relies on a PostgreSQL-based relational database and a simple, scalable web architecture. This baseline implementation can be expanded in future iterations with partitioning, TimescaleDB extensions for time-series optimization, or business intelligence tools as data volume and user needs grow.

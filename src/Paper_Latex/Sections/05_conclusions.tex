\section{Projected Conclusions and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}
% -------------------------------------------------
Early prototyping confirms that a PostgreSQL-centric stack—augmented by TimescaleDB hypertables, MinIO raw storage, and concurrent materialised views—can satisfy stringent latency and audit-trace requirements without the operational overhead of a full Kafka/Flink cluster.  
Once empirical tests are finished we expect to (i) validate sub-2 s end-to-end latency under 1 000 concurrent users, (ii) demonstrate that WHO-compliant health advice can be generated in real time from public data streams, and (iii) quantify storage savings from TimescaleDB compression.  

Future work will explore predictive models (e.g., ARIMAX or LSTM) trained on the expanded 2015–2024 dataset, edge-buffering for sensor fusion, and multi-region deployments that exploit logical replication in PostgreSQL 17.

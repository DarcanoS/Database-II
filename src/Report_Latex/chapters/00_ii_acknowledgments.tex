We would like to express our sincere gratitude to Professor Carlos Andrés Sierra for his guidance, support, and valuable insights throughout the development of this project. His expertise in database systems and dedication to teaching have been instrumental in shaping our understanding of advanced database architectures and their practical applications.

We are also grateful to Francisco José de Caldas District University, Faculty of Engineering, and the Systems Engineering Program for providing the academic environment and resources necessary to complete this work.

Special thanks to our families and friends for their continuous encouragement and support during the course of this project.

Finally, we acknowledge the open-source community and the developers of PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, MinIO, and other technologies that made this project possible. We also thank the organizations providing public air quality data APIs (AQICN, Google Air Quality, and IQAir) whose services are essential for environmental monitoring and public health research.

We also appreciate the assistance of modern AI tools that supported the documentation and writing process, helping us articulate technical concepts more clearly and efficiently.

ID,Role,AsA,IWantTo,SoThat,Priority,Effort,AcceptanceCriteria
US1,Technical Administrator,"As a technical administrator","I want to collect up-to-date air quality data from external providers in an automated way","So that the platform can provide accurate and current information on air quality without manual imports","Must",8,"Ingestion job runs on a configurable schedule (e.g., every 10-60 minutes); At least one external provider is ingested without manual intervention; Failed ingestions are logged with error details; Successful runs are logged with timestamps; Ingested readings appear in the database within the expected delay after the external API update"
US2,Researcher/Analyst,"As a researcher or analyst","I want to access historical air quality data filtered by city, date range, and pollutant","So that I can perform longitudinal analysis and scientific research","Must",5,"User can select city, date range, and pollutant from the interface; System returns matching records from historical data; Results can be exported to CSV and JSON; At least 3 years of historical data are available for test cities"
US3,Technical Administrator,"As a technical administrator","I want to run queries over large volumes of air quality data without significant delays","So that I can support analysts and dashboards without performance bottlenecks","Should",5,"Typical dashboard queries over AirQualityDailyStats complete in under 2 seconds for test datasets; Historical queries over several months complete in under 5 seconds; Database indexes for common filters (station, date, pollutant) are documented and enabled"
US4,Public Policy Manager,"As a public policy manager","I want to view dashboards with key air quality indicators for selected regions","So that I can quickly understand current conditions and recent trends to inform decisions","Must",8,"Dashboard shows at least: current AQI, main pollutant, and daily trend for the selected city or station; Dashboard updates when the user changes city or station; Dashboard uses AirQualityDailyStats for historical trends and raw readings for current values"
US5,Researcher/Analyst,"As a researcher or analyst","I want to generate custom reports with filters and download them","So that I can use the data in external tools or include it in my own analyses","Must",5,"User can configure a report by choosing city/region, date range, and pollutants; System generates the report and confirms when it is ready; User can download the report in at least CSV format"
US6,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to see simple graphs of how air quality changes over time in my city","So that I can understand whether conditions are improving or getting worse","Must",3,"User can select a city and a pollutant; System displays a time-series chart for the selected period; User can change the date range (e.g., last 7 days vs last 30 days) and the chart updates accordingly"
US7,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to receive simple recommendations based on current air quality at my location","So that I can protect my health when air quality is poor","Should",5,"User can set a default city or location; When AQI exceeds defined thresholds, the system shows recommendations such as avoiding outdoor exercise or using a mask; Recommendations are based on simple, documented rules (no complex machine learning required)"
US8,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to configure alerts when air quality exceeds a certain threshold","So that I can be notified when conditions become unhealthy","Must",5,"User can create an alert selecting city or station, pollutant, and AQI threshold; User can choose at least one notification channel (e.g., email or in-app notification); When AQI exceeds the configured threshold, an alert is recorded and shown; User can deactivate or delete existing alerts"
US9,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to see informational suggestions about protective measures during high pollution episodes","So that I can decide whether to use masks, air purifiers, or other measures","Could",3,"When AQI is above a defined level, the interface shows text with recommended protective measures; Suggestions are informational only and do not require e-commerce links"
US10,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to search air quality by country, city, or region","So that I can compare air quality in different places","Must",3,"User can search by country and see available cities or stations; User can search directly by city name and open its dashboard; If regions are defined, the user can filter stations by region"
US11,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to access the platform from different devices (mobile, tablet, desktop)","So that I can check air quality whenever I need it, from any device","Must",5,"Core views (home, dashboard, alerts) are usable on mobile, tablet, and desktop browsers; Layout adapts without breaking text or hiding essential information; No native mobile app is required, the responsive web app is sufficient"
US12,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to share air quality views with other people through social media or messaging","So that I can raise awareness about air quality conditions","Could",3,"User can obtain a shareable link to the current view or report; Link opens the same view for other users without requiring them to reapply filters"
US13,Citizen,"As a citizen","I want to experience fast loading times when using the platform","So that I do not abandon the platform due to slow responses","Must",5,"Under normal load, main dashboards load in under 2 seconds for test users; Pagination or lazy loading is used where necessary to avoid rendering very large lists at once"
US14,Technical Administrator,"As a technical administrator","I want to monitor ingestion jobs and detect failures","So that I can quickly react if external providers change or if ingestion stops","Should",5,"There is a view or log where the status of recent ingestion jobs is visible; For each job, the system stores timestamp, data source, and result (success or failure); Failure entries include a brief error message to guide debugging"

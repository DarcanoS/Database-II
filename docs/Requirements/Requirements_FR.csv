FR1,Functional,"US1, US13, US14","The system must collect real-time air quality data from multiple external sources (e.g., APIs, stations) and store it for further processing.",Baseline,Reword,"The system must periodically collect up-to-date air quality data from multiple external sources (e.g., APIs and monitoring stations) and store it for further processing.",Replaces 'real-time' ingestion with a periodic ingestion model that matches the Ingestion Job in the revised architecture.
FR2,Functional,"US2, US7","The system must allow users to query and visualize historical air quality data filtered by date, location, and pollutant type.",Baseline,Keep,"The system must allow users to query and visualize historical air quality data filtered by date range, location, and pollutant type.",Minor wording clean-up; requirement stays as a core feature.
FR3,Functional,"US1, US3",The system must display air quality information in a uniform and clear manner. The origin of the data is irrelevant.,Baseline,Reword,"The system must display air quality information in a consistent and clear format, independently of the original data source.",Highlights unified presentation and normalization of data from heterogeneous sources.
FR4,Functional,US4,The system must display real-time dashboards with key performance indicators (KPIs) on air quality.,Baseline,Reword,"The system must display dashboards with key air quality indicators (e.g., AQI, main pollutant, daily trends) based on the latest available data.",Removes strict 'real-time' wording and aligns dashboards with latest-ingested data plus daily aggregates.
FR5,Functional,US5,"The system must generate customized reports with filters for date, location, and indicators, available for download or email.",Baseline,Reword,"The system must generate custom reports with filters for date range, location, and selected indicators, and allow users to download these reports in standard formats.",Keeps reports as a core feature while simplifying delivery (download-focused instead of email-centric).
FR6,Functional,US6,The system must present interactive graphs showing air quality evolution over time.,Baseline,Reword,"The system must present graphs showing the evolution of air quality over time, allowing users to interact with basic controls such as selecting date ranges or toggling pollutants.","Clarifies that 'interactive' means simple UI controls, not advanced visualization tooling."
FR7,Functional,US7,The system must allow users to export historical data in standard formats like CSV and JSON.,Baseline,Reword,"The system must allow users to export historical air quality data in standard formats such as CSV and JSON, based on the filters applied in the user interface.",Links exports explicitly to the filters used in the UI and keeps export as a core research feature.
FR8,Functional,US8,The system must provide personalized recommendations based on user location and air quality conditions.,Baseline,Reword,"The system must provide simple, rule-based recommendations based on the user’s location and current air quality conditions (e.g., avoiding outdoor exercise, using a mask).",Limits recommendations to simple rule-based guidance instead of a complex recommendation engine.
FR9,Functional,US9,The system must send customizable air quality alerts when thresholds are exceeded.,Baseline,Reword,"The system must send air quality alerts when configurable thresholds are exceeded, according to each user’s notification preferences.",Keeps alerts as a core safety feature and emphasizes configurable thresholds and preferences.
FR10,Functional,US10,The system must suggest certified protective products during high pollution periods.,Optional,Reword,"The system may suggest appropriate protective measures and product categories (e.g., certified masks, air purifiers) during high pollution periods, as informational guidance only.","Scopes product suggestions as informational and optional, avoiding a full e-commerce feature."
FR11,Functional,US11,The system must display maps highlighting areas with better air quality for navigation.,Future work,Move to future work,"In a future phase, the system may provide a basic map-based visualization that highlights areas with better or worse air quality using simple overlays on a web map.","Interactive navigation maps are treated as a future enhancement, not part of the course baseline."
FR12,Functional,US15,"The system must support geographic search for air quality data by country, city, or region.",Baseline,Keep,"The system must support geographic search for air quality data by country, city, or region.",Requirement is kept as-is and aligned with the Station / MapRegion model.
FR13,Functional,US16,"The system must be responsive and compatible with mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.",Baseline,Reword,"The system must provide a responsive web interface that works correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.","Clarifies that the client is a responsive web app, not a native mobile application."
FR14,Functional,US17,The system must allow users to share air quality data and reports on social media with pre-generated links and previews.,Optional,Reword,"The system may allow users to share links to selected air quality views or reports on social media platforms, using simple shareable URLs.",Reduces the feature to simple shareable links and marks it as optional instead of core scope.
